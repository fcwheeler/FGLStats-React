# FGLStats-React

This project is designed to show reporting elements about the FGL league (#942 for now ) and act as a learning project. All are welcome to contribute.

The data is currently scrapped from the FGL website, via AWS Lambda functions.

Tools used for this project:
React
Redux
Highcharts
AWS API Gateway
AWS Lambda
AWS Amplify
Material UI


ToDo: Implement DB (probably DynamoDB given the AWS bias here).


Production site is http://fglstats.com
